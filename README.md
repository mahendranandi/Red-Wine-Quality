# Red-Wine-Quality

Hello All.

Here is the visualization part of various dependencies of quality of wine from RED WINE QUALITY dataset [ https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009] .
You can find 2 .R file. 1st run all the lines of both the files once. This time ignore all the warnings and errors.
Next run again the code , now try to understand the codes , you can easily understand and get all plots. Though some plots may take time to arrive please wait for soemtime if anyplot shows no error but just warning . I guess in the middle portion you may struggle to get some plots . I am providing all the plots here too. 

I shall add a report explaining all the things though , you are requested to do further work for a regression model that can predict the quality . And you can also take it as a classification problem to solve ( considering quality of 3,4 as low-quality;  5,6 as medium quality and 7,8 as high quality )
If you have any question to ask me please feel free to ask . and I will be happy to help you . Email ID:  mahendranandi.rkma@gmail.com
